 -   [Houndify API](https://houndify.com/)
 -   [IBM Speech to Text](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/speech-to-text.html)

**Supported file types:**

 - .wav
 - .mp3
 - .ogg

## Usage

 1. Install requirements
	`pip install -r requirements.txt`
 2. Edit `config.txt` file.
It is described below.
 3. Copy your files to the 'source' folder.
 4. Run `main.py`
 5. Enjoy it!

### How do I edit the `config.txt` file?

 - **LANGUAGE:** Use [ISO 639-1](https://www.andiamo.co.uk/resources/iso-language-codes/) standard language codes. For example, if your language/dialect is British English, it is better to use  "en-GB"  as the language rather than  "en-US".
 - **NOISE_REDUCTION:** Recommended to turn it on if it is in a noisy environment. Otherwise, turn it off for a better result. (only supports several engines and APIs)
 - **BUFFER_SIZE:** Long files may time out. That's why speeches are processed by cutting. This is the buffer size in seconds. (default: 60 sec)
- **SERVICE:** Select the engine or API you want to use. It is described below.
